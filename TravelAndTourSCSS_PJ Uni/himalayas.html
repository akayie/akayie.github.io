            <h2>Nat Ma Taung National Park - Mt. Victoria, Dense forests and Rare Birds</h2>
            <p>Located in 3 townships of Kanpatlet, Mindat and Matupi, Nat Ma Taung National Park covers the Chin Hills, home to a variety of rare flora and fauna and the mysterious facial-tattooed women.

                <h2>Rih Lake - Mountain, Lake and Rice Paddies</h2>
                <p> Rih Lake is a natural lake that lies in northwestern Chin State of western Myanmar.

                  The heart-shaped lake shines a deep blue, surrounded by rice paddies and rolling hills. The hills are covered by lush forests and the color of rice paddies varies in different seasons. For the best view, you can hike up to a nearby hill that overlooked the lake.<br>However, it is not easy to arrive. The only way to get to the closest town to Rih Lake - Rihkhawdar is via Tiddim. Tiddim is accessed from Hakha, the Chin Capital. From Tiddim, you need to overcome a 9-hour of bumpy mountain roads.

                  Therefore, it may be unnecessary to travel across half the country for just a lake. However, if you are heading to northern Chin State, you may visit the lake by the way.</p>
