  <h2 align="center" class="about_h2"> Bagan is One Of The Most Visited Places in Myanmar</h2>

  <p class="thing_text_two">
    Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is one of the most beautiful countries in Asia, and a true delight for travelers
    with a sense of adventure. While some parts of the country are still off-limits to tourists, there are still enough
    amazing sights and things to do in Burma to keep you busy for many months. Not the least of these are two of the
    most popular attractions in Myanmar, Inle Lake and the Bagan Temple Complex.

    The temples of Bagan and the Inle Lake are both in the central region of Myanmar, yet are still far from each other,
    with more than 350 kilometers between them. Located to the northwest and northeast of the country’s capital
    Naypyitaw, these two amazing sites are places that require a longer time to explore than most tourist destinations.
    With no flight travel between them available, the only way to travel from one to the other is a grueling ten-hour
    local bus ride.
  </p>

    <div class="things_text">
      <h2> Why You Should Never Miss Bagan for Myanmar Tour</h2>
      <p>
        Lying in central Myanmar, around 270 kilometers to the northwest of the nation’s new capital of Naypyitaw, Bagan
        is one of the most historical landmarks in Asia. Comprising of more than 2,000 Buddhist temples and pagodas,
        this ancient city is more than a rival for the sights of Angkor or Machu Picchu. A relatively unknown location
        in international tourism, it still has fewer tourists than other Burmese cities, which allows for a more
        exciting and less crowded experience.
        <br>
        The temples that stretch across the Bagan Plain are close together, which makes for some of the world’s most
        incredible views, especially when the sun is rising and setting and the hot air balloons are rising over the
        city. While a large number of the temples are damaged, they can all be explored inside and out, giving you a
        more personal experience of some of Asia’s ancient Buddhist architecture.

        Of the 2,000 plus temples that are spread across the plain, there are some that stand out as the most striking
        and most exciting to visit, such as the Ananda temple, with its symmetrical design and golden spire that can be
        seen across the entire plain.

      </p>
    </div>

  </section>
  <p class="thing_text_two">
    Almost 1,000 years old, the temple is one of the largest and most well-preserved of the temples in Bagan, and is an
    important site to the local Buddhist population.

    Other pagodas, such as Shwesandaw, Shwezigon, and Sulamani, are just as impressive, with architecture that varies
    from stupas and octagonal terraces to gold-plated domes, layered terraces and spires, and ancient murals that tell
    of the life of Buddha.
  </p>

  <section class="thingsto">

    <div class="things_text">
      <h2> Myit Sone Pagoda</h2>
      <p>
        Lying on the banks of the vast Irrawaddy River, which flows from the Myit Sone Pagoda in the far north of the
        country all the way to the Andaman Sea, one of the most popular activities of tourists after a full day of
        touring the temple city is to do nothing, but do it on a river boat along the Irrawaddy River. One of the most
        laid-back ways to relax in Bagan, the sunset boat trips are a great way to relax, with other boats sillhoutted
        against the setting sun and the view of the mountains behind while you drink tea and eat snacks on the boat.
        <br>
        AS if all of that is not enough, there is more to entice you to Bagan for your tour break. Instead of taking the
        usual electric bikes and riding around the temple city to explore the various temples and pagodas, you can take
        a horse and cart ride around the complex in a much more relaxed manner. Not only is the distance between temples
        far, but some temples themselves are too huge to explore on foot. Horse-carts are a traditional mode of
        transport in Burma, and can be booked in the city or found beside many of the bigger temples spread across the
        vast plain. While it may be a slower way of traveling around the city, it is a better way to take in the
        spectacular scenery of the areas between the temples, instead of rushing from one temple to the next.

    Bagan is famous for its historical monuments and houses around 2000 monuments from different periods. It is the most
    important historical site in Myanmar and is awe-inspiring. With a rich history of over 1500 years, Bagan stands
    evidence to achievements made by men before any technological innovation came into being.

      <h2>2000 Wonders Await Take on THE Temple Run! </h2>
      <p>Tucked away in central Myanmar and home to more than 2.000 temples, Bagan’s beauty and historical significance
        is unsurpassed. Sacred pagodas and beautiful temples are scattered across the plains, creating a mystical,
        striking landscape. The marathon course will take runners on a voyage of discovery into this alluring and
        seemingly untouched land.
        <br>
        Choose to run the marathon, half-marathon, or 10 km - or come along and cheer!

        -Daily life of the Bagan people revolves around the Buddhist faith. Aside from strict observance of Buddhist
        Sabbath days, people uphold age-old traditions such as respect for monks and elders, and scheduling important
        events on lucky days according to the Buddhist calendar.

        NB. Due to the political climate in Bagan at the moment, we have decided to put the Bagan Temple Marathon on
        hold for the unforeseeable future.

        We wish our friends in Bagan all the best.
