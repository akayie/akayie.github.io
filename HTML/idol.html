        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>As a student, RM had an IQ of 148 and scored in the top 1% of the nation in the university entrance examinations for language, math, foreign language and social studies.[12] Because his parents had been strongly opposed to his interest in a musical career due to his academic achievements, RM initially decided to set music aside to focus on his studies. He eventually convinced his mother to allow him to be a rapper, asking her if "she wanted to have a son who was a first-place rapper, or a 5,000th-place student".[8]

            In March 2019, after graduating from Global Cyber University with a degree in Broadcasting and Entertainment, RM enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University's Master of Business Administration program in Advertising and Media.[13] </p>
        <p>He attended the Apgujeong High School. He majored in Electric engineering (Bachelor) at the Global Cyber University, where he is currently still enrolled. Furthermore, he studied abroad in New Zealand for six months and speaks English fluently.
             As a child, RM largely learned English by watching the American sitcom Friends with his mother.
             As a student, he actively wrote poetry and often received awards for his writing. He posted his work to an online poetry website for roughly one year, where he received moderate attention.
            "My name is Rap Monster, not Dance Monster." </p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>2010–2013: Joining Big Hit Entertainment and debut with BTS RM trained for three years with fellow rapper Min Yoon-gi and dancer Jung Ho-seok, later known as Suga and J-Hope, respectively.[19][20] During this three-year trainee period, RM performed on five pre-debut tracks credited to BTS in 2010 and 2011.[citation needed] He also worked as a songwriter for girl group Glam and helped pen their debut single "Party (XXO)", a pro-LGBTQ song that was praised by Billboard as "one of the most forward-thinking songs out of a K-pop girl group in the past decade."[21] On June 13, 2013, RM made his debut with BTS[22] and has since produced and written lyrics for many tracks on their albums. On August 29, 2013, RM performed the intro track to BTS' first extended play (EP) O!RUL8,2?, which was released as a trailer ahead of the EP's September 11 release, marking his first solo after debuting.[23]</p>
        <p>During BTS' ninth anniversary celebrations, in June 2022, RM mentioned needing time to think about his direction as a member of BTS and as an individual.[60] Pursuant to an accompanying announcement that the band would be devoting more attention to individual endeavors going forward[61][62]—they went on an extended break from most group activities shortly afterwards[60]—he featured on the single "Sexy Nukim" by "alternative K-pop group" Balming Tiger in September,[63] and released his debut solo studio album Indigo on December 2.[64] Led by the single "Wild Flower", the album was released commercially and peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, making RM the highest-charting Korean soloist in chart history at the time.[65][66]

            RM traveled to Spain for inspiration for a second solo album in 2023. While there, in an interview with EFE—it was published in March—he reflected on the search for his own identity, after having followed the dictates of K-pop trends for the past 10 years as part of BTS, additionally revealing that he would "not be taking on any projects in the near future" in light of his approaching mandatory military service.[67] RM appeared as a featured artist on the single "Smoke Sprite" by So!yoON!, lead singer and guitarist of Korean indie rock band SE SO NEON, released on March 14,[68] and was announced as the first celebrity brand ambassador for Bottega Veneta at the end of that month, through an Instagram post by Creative Director Matthieu Blazy which showcased RM in the brand's Spring/Summer 2023 campaign.[69] In May, he featured on the single "Don't Ever Say Love Me" by Colde.[70]
            With 218 songs attributed to his name as a songwriter and composer by the Korea Music Copyright Association (KOMCA), as of November 2023, RM is the youngest and second most-credited songwriter in the association's history.
