            <h2>Explore Ngapali Beaches and its Surrounding Islands</h2>
            <p> Beach addicts can find a place to visit in Myanmar. Located on the west coast, Ngapali is the most famous seaside resort in Myanmar. But it is incredibly quiet than you imagine.

                Nightlife and discos aren't the highlights, instead, people go here just to relax on the beach. There are endless blue ocean, soft and white sand beaches and rows of lush palm trees. You can also expect the gorgeous sunsets over the horizon.
                <br>
                Ngapali extends over 7 kilometers and offers a total of 3 bays. Most hotels locate in the south, between the village of Ngapali and the fishing village of Gyeiktaw. The locals mainly gather in the northern beach for swimming. The third one is much smaller.
                
                Around Ngapali, there are some more pristine islands like the Pearl Island that are available by a boat offered by the local fishermen. You can expect an exciting snorkeling boat adventure.</p>

                <h2>Take a Boat Excursion to Sagar </h2>
                <p> Inle Lake is one of the highlights in all Myanmar tours. There are enchanting nature, amazing sunset, a unique living system on the lake and magical fishermen. However, due to the development of tourism, Inle Lake proves to be increasingly touristy.

                    Alternatively, you can head towards the far south of Inle Lake to discover the village of Sagar that is untouched by time.<br> You can see very few tourists here. There are ancient pagodas abandoned by the lakeside. Covered by mosses and hidden by growing plants, these pagoda ruins have blended into the greenery.
                    
                    As you boat through the weed-choked narrow water lanes, you can find farmers working the fields. Getting on the shore to stroll around the village, you can meet buffaloes and sheep walking on the dusty roads and dogs and cats taking a nap in the grass.</p>

            <h2>Cruise on Ayeyarwady River</h2>
            <p>Ayeyarwady River, also known as Irrawaddy River, flows through Myanmar from north to south. It is the largest river in Myanmar and serves as the most important commercial waterway.

                The daily activities you can expect during an Ayeyarwady River cruise include village excursion ashore, cultural discussions and cooking class on the cruise, and opportunities to watch life on and along the river.<br> When the sun pops up or sets, you can get perfect views of the mighty sunrise and sundown over the Ayeyarwady River. The most popular cruise itinerary on Ayeyarwady River is between Mandalay and Bagan, lasting 3 to 4 days. En route, you will get off the cruise to explore the two of Myanmar's most culturally significant sites and visit several river villages, for example, the pot-making village of Yandabo.</p>

            <h2>Ngwe Saung Beach, Ayeyarwady Division</h2>
            <p> South of Ngapali and closer to Yangon, Ngwe Saung is another one of the loveliest and most pleasant beaches in Myanmar with a long stretch of golden sand, back by swaying palms and dotted with simple mid-range beach resorts. As the beach is right in front of the Bay of Bengal, it is nicely granted with clear blue waters, white-crested waves and unspoiled and pollution-free natural surroundings.<br> Though there are fewer beach activities and games available to compare with the developed Ngapali, you can try a variety of fantastic seafood dishes here at cheap prices, including crab, shrimp, lobster, and various types of fish; hire a bicycle and take a ride to the town villages or just sit back and contemplate picturesque beach views in the peaceful ambience. The beach is not only a favourite destination for domestic but also an increasing number of international visitors, especially when it is reachable from Yangon by car within just 5 hours</p>
