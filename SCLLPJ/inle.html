  <h2 align="center" class="expect_inle"> Inle Lake is One Of The Most Visited Places in Myanmar</h2>

  <p class="thing_text_two">
    In western Shan State, you will find picturesque Inle Lake, famous for its floating villages and gardens and the
    unique way of life of the local Intha people, with their living communities based entirely on the water. For
    practical information including restaurants, ATMs, accommodation and transport, visit our Nyaung Shwe page. The
    lake, which measures 22 km long by 10 km wide, and sits in a valley between two mountain ranges, feels like a
    different world to the rest of Myanmar: in villages and towns across the lake, wooden houses are built on stilts and
    fishermen steer their one-man boats with a characteristic rowing style, wrapping one leg around their oar. There
    also are many restaurants dotted around, where you can indulge in their delicious catches of the day.

    Inle is one of Myanmar’s most popular destinations for travellers, so when you travel around the lake, part of what
    you see will inevitably be geared towards tourists.
  </p>
  <section class="thingsto">
    <div class="himalayas_img">

    </div>

    <div class="things_text">
      <h2> A brief history of Inle Lake</h2>
      <p>
        Along with fishing, traditional handicrafts are an important part of the local economy, and you will get to see
        silk weavers and silversmiths plying their trade on the lake. And as with all of Myanmar, religion plays a
        massive part in local life, and numerous pagodas and monasteries can be found on the lake and its shores.
        You may be taken to one too many handicraft workshops, as most guides get commission on sales, and negative
        examples of tourism development can be seen in everything from environmental degradation to the Kayan women
        found selling items in some village shops, wearing the traditional rings which elongate their necks; taking
        photos of them is encouraged, but the tribe is not in fact indigenous to this area - their own home is in the
        hills south west of Loikaw.
        <br>

        However, in many places the authentic life on the lake shines through, and it is so large – and the sites
        sufficiently spread out – that, outside of the villages and markets, it is always possible to find quiet,
        untouristy corners. Furthermore, steps are being taken to protect the area from man-made damage, including
        UNESCO designating Inle as a biosphere reserve.
      </p>
    </div>

  <section class="thingsto">

    <div class="things_text">
      <h2> Getting around Inle lake</h2>
      <p>
        Most boat trips around Inle Lake start at the town of Nyaung Shwe, a few kilometers to its north (where most
        budget and mid-range accommodation is found), although some people may base themselves at the hotels dotted
        around the lake’s shores (mostly luxury). There is a K12,500 entry fee for the Inle Lake area, which you pay
        when entering Nyaung Shwe.
        <br>
        The boarding area is located around the bridge at the western end of Yone Gyi Road in Nyaung Shwe, where local
        fishermen and guides compete for mooring space. From here, you will want to set off early in the morning for
        your trip around the lake.
        Check with your guide if you want to have a swim in the lake, because the water can be very shallow (in most
        parts around 1.5 to 3 metres) and pollution may be an issue at certain times of year. Remember to pack your
        sunscreen before a day on the lake, because between stops there is no shade out there.

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="himalayas_img">

    </div>
  </section>
  <p class="thing_text_two">

    There is a lot to see on Inle Lake and in the villages that surround it, so, unless you stay in the area for three
    days or more, you will need to be selective about what you want to see and do. Boat drivers, who also act as tour
    guides, will advise you on many of the best sights on the lake and its shores, but highlights can be found listed
    below. You can hire a bicycle for around K1500 per day in Nyaung Shwe, allowing you to explore the beautiful scenery
    on the eastern side of the lake, including Maing Thauk and the Red Mountain Estate vineyard.

    <div class="things_text">
      <h2> Ywama village and the Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda</h2>
      <p> Ywama is a typical example of a traditional Inle Lake settlement, and is most famous for its floating market.
        It also has various handicraft workshops, a monastery and the Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda, one of the holiest sites in
        Shan State, visited by Buddhist worshippers from all around Myanmar. The shrine itself is huge and features five
        ancient golden Buddhas, and next to it can be found a large golden barge, a replica of the one said to have been
        used by King Alaung Sithu to travel around the country.
        <br>
        The Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda festival takes place in October and features the passage of four revered Buddha images
        around the villages of Inle Lake on the barge, taking 18 days to complete their journey. There are also rowing
        competitions between the villages, using the renowned local leg rowing style. For exact dates and full Myanmar
        festival listings, go to our festivals calendar.

  <h2 class="thing_text_one"> Red Mountain Estate vineyard</h2>
  <p class="thing_text_two">
    For an entirely different type of experience, head up to the Red Mountain Estate vineyard in the hills to the east
    of Inle Lake for some wine tasting. One of only two vineyards in Myanmar, this definitely breaks the mould of your
    day-to-day Myanmar experience, making it suddenly feel as if you have been transplanted to the south of France. You
    can try the inexpensive tasting menu (featuring wines from four different types of grape) whilst taking in the
    stunning sunset views over the lake. The vineyard can be reached by taxi or bicycle from Nyaung Shwe or the hotels
    on the east side of the lake.

      <h2> Nampan village and floating gardens
      </h2>
      <p>

        The village of Nampan is another an excellent example of a traditional floating village, with its wooden houses
        all built on stilts. In the village you will find hand-made cheroot (traditional local cigar) factories and the
        oldest pagoda on the lake, the Alodaw Pauk Pagoda, a large gem-encrusted golden shrine. There are also several
        good, affordable restaurants here.
        <br>Just to the north of the village, you will find floating gardens where the Intha people grow a variety of
        vegetables and flowers, both for their own consumption and to export around the country. This method of
        agriculture is another unique aspect of life on the lake, as the villagers harness nature to develop these
        gardens over many generations.
