              Burmese Buddhist Parents are very proud of their son because giving birth to one of Buddha's Son is a merit and the greatest gift for good deeds of their life. families with daughters are also proud of their daughters because they can give birth to future novices and for this life they add their donations in the novitiation ceremony. Some families get together and celebrate the ceremony by walking around the neighborhood before accepting to become a novice and shave their head.
