            <h2>Mya Thein Tan Pagoda</h2>
            <p> Serving as a memorial and modeled on a mythical location, the Mya Thein Tan Pagoda (also known as Hshinphyume Pagoda), is a large white pagoda located close to The Mingun Pahtodawgyi.In 1836, the Mya Thein Tan Pagoda fell victim to an earthquake that struck Min Kun. Left in ruins after the disaster, King Mindon restored the white pagoda in 1874.
              <br>
              Constructed by King Bagyidaw in 1816, the Mya Thein Tan Pagoda represents Mount Meru, a sacred Buddhist mountain. The seven-tiered terraces resembled the mountain ranges topped by a stupa representing the legendary Sulamani pagoda. The king had the pagoda constructed in memory of his beloved consort and cousin, Princess Hshinphyume, who died in childbirth near the site where the pagoda was built. The pagoda now carries her namesake.Many local visitors wear traditional Burmese clothing and carry parasols with them or rent one upon entering the pagoda to take photos as a souvenir.

                <h2>Werawsana Jade Pagoda
                  Kyaukse, Myanmar (Burma) </h2>
                <p>From atop its square base within a thicket of gardens, the Werawsana Jade Pagoda towers alongside an expressway. It’s hard to miss the kaleidoscope of gemstones that gleams from its every inch.

                  The entire pagoda is made from jade. According to Myanmar’s government, it’s the first pagoda in the world constructed solely from the precious stone
                  <br>
                  Work on the monumental structure began in 2012 and didn’t finish until 2015. Even before construction started, a jewelry trader named U Soe Naing spent about 25 years collecting and stockpiling all the jade. He had to gather over 11,000 tons of the stones to build the pagoda.

                  A series of chambers for praying and making merit ring the roughly 75-foot-tall structure. The exterior walls are inlaid with arrays of carved amulets, sculpted leaves, and inscriptions.

            <h2>Inn Wa, Myanmar (Burma)
              A grand imperial capital left to fall into magnificent ruin. </h2>
            <p>For a total of 360 years spread over the course of five centuries, Inwa was the capital of successive Burmese kingdoms.

              Inwa — also spelled Innwa, known in classical Pali as Ratanapura (“City of Gems”), and known locally as Awa or Ava — was originally founded in 1365. Located at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Myitnge Rivers on an artificial island formed by a canal connecting the two rivers upstream from their natural point of meeting, Inwa was built to be the capital of a newly unified kingdom that came to be known, appropriately enough, as the Kingdom of Ava.
            <br>

            The former imperial city is now a rural area where livestock graze and farmers raise crops amidst the remains of pagodas, palace towers, monasteries, and massive city walls that once formed the outline of a seated lion. One of the monasteries — Bagaya Kyaung, a towering structure built entirely of teak — is still in use as a monastery and school today. Local guides provide tours of the site via horse-drawn carts.

                <h2>Thanboddhay Pagoda [Luxurious devotion and 500,000 images of Buddha in Myanmar.]</h2>
                <p>On the average cathedral tour of Europe, tourists quietly take in the immense stained glass, the high vaulted ceilings and somber atmosphere. The average pagoda tour on the other hand is the complete opposite, and in many ways the most quintessential difference between East and West.

                  Thanboddhay Pagoda is a massive Buddhist complex in Monywa, Myanmar. It is a gilded world, brightly screaming out praise for Buddha through colorful celebration. 
                  <br>
                  From statues inside the pagoda, to miniatures climbing the sides of the building itself, there are 500,000 depictions of Buddha in total., it was reconstructed in 1939, and is incredibly preserved in its golden form.

                  Unlike many other temples in Myanmar, the entrance is not guarded by lions. Instead, two imposing white elephants stand out against their shimmering backdrop. Since its reconstruction, the pagoda has been one of the largest tourist attractions in Myanmar, drawing awe-struck tourists and pious religious visitors alike.

            <h2>The Mingun Pagoda and Bell [ Gigantic unfinished stupa and the world's 2nd largest bell]
            </h2>
            <p>Nice pile of bricks you’ve got here. The Mingun Pahtodawgyi is a nice pile of bricks indeed and holds the record for being the biggest pile of bricks in the world.

              Intended to be a 500 foot high stupa, a mound housing Buddhist relics, the Pahtodawgyi remains unfinished to this day but is still an awe-inspiring structure. Measuring 450 by 450 feet and 172 feet high, it dwarfs the surrounding area, and would easily have rivaled the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza had King Bodawpaya finished its construction.
              <br> 
              The massive bell can be rung by striking the outside since it has no internal ringing mechanism.

              Since the early 19th century, the stupa has become increasingly decrepit. An earthquake in 1839 left giant cracks along the face of the stupa, and wear and tear have led it to become almost natural looking. Without the bright white entrance, visitors could easily mistake the stupa for a large earthen mound, or simply a pile of bricks.
