            <h2>htamin jin</h2>
            <p> 
                A Burmese dish of fermented rice, htamin jin is the regional speciality and signature dish of the Intha people of Inle Lake in Shan State. Fresh or fermented rice is kneaded with boiled fish, fresh tomato paste, mashed boiled potatoes and garlic garnish. This traditional Myanmar dish uses Highland Shan rice, with Shan potatoes, which are creamier and give the dish a rich texture. Garlic chives roots, garlic oil and crispy garlic garnish are added as a final touch. Htamin Jin is usually served with roasted chilli flakes in oil....<br>.Htamin Jin is a Burmese Shan dish that combines rice that has been cooked with turmeric and squashed into a disk with a topping of flakes of freshwater fish and garlic oil. It is oily and savory, when served with sides of leek roots, cloves of raw garlic and deep-fried pork rinds. It also becomes a snack that runs the gamut from pungent to spicy.

                Highland Shan rice, similar to Japanese rice, is used alongside the creamier Shan potatoes, giving the dish a very rich texture.

                <h2>Burmese Chicken Curry </h2>
                <p> The cuisine of Burma/Myannmar is influenced by its neighbours, China, India and Thailand. This curry definitely has an Indian and Thai influence, but with a unique personality of its own. The aromas of ginger, lemongrass and umami fish sauce scents the air whenever it's on the stove.

                    Chicken thighs - thigh meat has more flavour and stays super-juicy when cooked in a sauce. Breast meat will dry out, so avoid. You can use legs if you like, just remove the skin.<br>
                    Fresh - Onion, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and tomatoes make up the fragrance to the sauce.
                    Spices - Chilli powder, paprika, turmeric and a mild or hot Indian curry powder is all you need for ALL that flavour and colour.
                    Fish sauce - The special flavour comes from fish sauce, a South East Asian staple, with its salty umami flavour. It's essential!
                    Garnishes - You don't NEED to garnish, but I like to add a little cilantro, red chilli and thinly sliced fresh ginger to extend all that lovely                     Burmese personality.

            <h2>How To Make Classic Mohinga</h2>
            <p>Heat the oven to 350°F. Spread the rice across a rimmed baking pan and bake, giving the pan an occasional stir, until the rice is an even golden color and aromatic, 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature and then pulverize in a clean coffee grinder.
              To make the broth, select a large wide pot that will fit the catfish comfortably with room to spare. (An 8-quart pot works well.) Add the water, lemongrass, ginger, bay leaves, black and white pepper, and salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.<br>
              
              When the fish is cool enough to handle, pull off the skin and discard. Separate the cooked fish from the bones, trying to keep the skeleton (or skeleton portions if the fish is cut in pieces) intact. Set aside the cooked fish. Return the skeleton (including head and tail) to the pot.
              Bring the pot to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  You will have about 10 cups. Give the pot a quick rinse (when it’s cool enough to handle), and return the broth to the pot.

                <h2>LAHPET THOKE (BURMESE FERMENTED TEA LEAVES SALAD)
                </h2>
                <p> Lahpet, also spelled laphet, laphat, lephet, leppet, or letpet in English (Burmese: လက်ဖက်; MLCTS: lak hpak, pronounced [ləpʰɛʔ]), is Burmese for fermented or pickled tea. Myanmar is one of the few countries where tea is consumed both as a drink and as an eaten delicacy, in the form of pickled tea, which is unique to this region. Laphet is regarded as a national delicacy that plays a significant role in Burmese society, and remains a traditional Burmese gesture of hospitality and is served to guests visiting a home.[1][2]<br>

                  Its place in the cuisine of Myanmar is reflected by the following popular expression: "Of all the fruit, the mango's the best; of all the meat, pork's the best; and of all the leaves, lahpet's the best". In the West, laphet is most commonly encountered in "tea leaf salad" (လက်ဖက်သုပ်).[3][4]
                  
                  Fermented or pickled tea is featured in the cuisines of many ethnicities who live near the geographical origin of tea, such as the cuisines of the Bulang,[5] and in Tai cuisine (where it is known as miang in dishes such as miang kham).</p>
