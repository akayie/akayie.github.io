            <h2>Where to see Shinbyu, a novice initiation ceremony</h2>
            <p> Shinbyu, the novice initiation ceremony, is a two-day rite of passage mimicking the Buddha's transition from secular to spiritual, beginning with a ceremony and parade at the temple and through the town, privately funded either by the boys' families – who often save for years to contribute – or wealthy members of the community, allowing poor children and even orphans to participate in the extravaganza.<br>

              After parading around the pagoda, the celebration we are witnessing in Magwe – held on an auspicious date just prior to Burmese New Year – continues into town, with the young princes boarding elephants and horses and the raucous parade gaining momentum as it approaches the monastery.<br>
              A prominent figure in the celebration is a dancing clown with a moustache, U Shwe Yoe, and his gender-fluid sidekick, Daw Moe, based on characters from a 1923 Burmese film. Their madcap dance and exaggerated gestures have become an essential part of traditional ceremonies, all for the amusement of spectators.</p>

                <h2>Burmese Buddhist monks </h2>
                <p> Monks, collectively known as the sangha (community), are venerated members of Burmese society. Among many ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Bamar and Shan, Theravada Buddhism is practiced in conjunction with the worship of nats, which are spirits who can intercede in worldly affairs.Monks living in a village serve also as teachers and counsellors for their followers, not only concerning reli- gious matters but also as part of a monk's en- gagement in other village activities. It is fairly easy to become a monk in Burma and the way to liberation is open to all.
                  <br>
                  As monks we share a common goal, and that goal is union with God. We want to give our life to God. Our vows are not some ascetic weights that God puts on us to punish us, or to make an example out of us. The monastic vows, at their core, are about relationship (just as a marriage vow is about relationship)

            <h2>Myanmar's traditional costumes</h2>
            <p>Traditional costumes of Myanmar consist of two parts: Longyi (the bottom) and taipon (the top). For Burmese males and females, there is a twist in how this traditional set is worn. Burmese women’s traditional longyi is called thummy. But unlike men's side, thummy has the right side up and marked by a band in the waist area. For both Burmese women and men, they are usually free in mixing longyi with any taipon (top) that they want. Footwear can be flip-flops or shoes depending on the occasion.
            <br>
              People from other countries, only wear traditional clothes on special occasions and events of national festivals. However, Myanmar traditional costumes are worn every day in daily life because they are a kind of comfortable and brisk clothes, and very suitable for the hot weather of this country. The manipulation of wearing traditional costumes of Myanmar people is very simple; therefore, they are easy to take in and take off those clothes when needed in everyday life.</p>

                <h2>Thanaka - The Bark Behind Burmese Beauty</h2>
                <p> Thanaka (Burmese: သနပ်ခါး; MLCTS: sa. nap hka:; pronounced [θənəkʰá]) is a paste made from ground bark. It is a distinctive feature of the culture of Myanmar, seen commonly applied to the face and sometimes the arms of women and girls, and is used to a lesser extent also by men and boys.<br>Besides its cosmetic use, thanaka also has several practical benefits. The paste acts as a natural sunscreen, protecting the skin from the harsh tropical sun of Myanmar. It also has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which help in keeping the skin cool, preventing acne, and reducing skin irritation.Thanakha is a natural cosmetic that you can only see in Myanmar. Thanaka bark is highly antioxidant, vitamin E and absorbs UV rays which protect our skin against free radicals and polluted air. It's also protected from the sun, lightening of the skin.</p>

            <h2>The Traditional U Shwe Yoe & Daw Moe Dance in Myanmar</h2>
            <p> Originally performed as a solo act, the Daw Moe Dance was created and added to the original Shwe Yoe. Today, the art form is popularly known as the "U Shwe Yoe & Daw Moe." 
              The dance aptly pokes fun at both the aging male womanizer (U Shwe Yoe) and spinster (Daw Moe). Commonly performed in the countryside, the dance satirizes the old upper Burmese class who become social misfits due to their eccentricities.
              The U Shwe Yoe dances with comedic movements to woo young women. He dances to the rhythmic sounds of double-faced short drums, cymbals, and bamboo clappers.<br> The signature costume and accessories of a U Shwe Yoe performer are his iconic long-trimmed mustache, a scarf around his neck, a headgear, and a sarong around his waist, depicting a typical old Myanmar gentleman.
              The storyline centers on a middle-aged spinster searching for a husband. She dances flirtingly with U Shwe Yoe (the Burmese old man), who does not like old women and acts as if he is looking for other pretty young girls. It is especially famous for its humorous performance.</p>
